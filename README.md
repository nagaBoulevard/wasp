# wasp

Wasp is a toy-like programming language, developed for my personal interest.

Wasp is an interpreted style language, with a Lisp based syntax.
The following are currently avaible in Wasp:
- basic math operations 

   (addiction, subtraction, multiplication, division)

- printing to stout

- Dot argument operations
  
  The (add 3 (add 5 7)) can be rewritten as (5 .add 7 .add 3)
  
 
 
Currently the language is not under development
